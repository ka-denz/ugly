        <h1>We Hate Wizard!!!</h1>

        <h2>The website dedicated to hating Wizard</h2>
        <p>Wizard, formerly known as Mushy, is an evil being. If it were up to us she would not be allowed to roam the streets, even after she tried turning over a new leaf. Measure was taken to keep her contained, yet she insists on using the bathroom outside and needing "walks" to keep her "healthy". She is a sleeper agent and her wake word is not a word, but instead an object. That object is rotisserie chicken. Do not engage with her while she is awakened, she turns even more evil. There have been 2 recorded incidents regarding rotisserie chicken and we are in constant surveillence to ensure it doesn't happen again. Wizard is often watching us as well. She gets really angry when we leave her line of sight, so angry, in fact, that when we reenter her sight she will attack us and yell and pee. Why does she care so much if we leave? She is evil and is hiding something; that is something we are sure of.</p>
